## Rankr
Rankr is an Android app that lets you compete in a leaderboard with your friends and co-workers in leagues grouped by organization.

Rankings are established by the Elo Ranking System. 

[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.danielw.rankr&hl=en) listing.

Rankr brings offices, small groups, and communities together through casual 
competition. 

Groups can form a league, where specific games can be created within (such as Ping-pong). Members get invited through email, and compete with friends to climb to the top of the leaderboard.

With Rankr, we hope that you and your squad can finally figure out who the best player of each game is. Whether it is Foosball, Ping Pong, Pool, Beer Pong, or anything you, your friends, or colleagues can come up with.
